# Lab: Building a Basic Next.js Application

## Overview

In this lab, you'll build a fundamental Next.js application. Next.js is a popular React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. Your task will involve setting up a new Next.js project, creating multiple pages, implementing navigation between them, and adding some basic styling. This lab is perfect for getting acquainted with Next.js and understanding its core features.

## Objectives

1. Initialize a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`.
2. Create multiple pages within the application.
3. Implement navigation between pages using Next.js's Link component.
4. Apply basic styling to the pages.

## Roadmap

### Exercise 1: Setting Up Your Next.js Project

- Run `npx create-next-app@latest` in your terminal to create a new Next.js project.
- Navigate to your project directory and open it in your code editor to explore the default structure.

### Exercise 2: Creating Basic Pages

- Create at least three different pages in the `app` directory. For example, `Home`, `About`, and `Contact`.
- Each page should be a React component and should have basic content like a heading and a paragraph.

### Exercise 3: Implementing Navigation

- Use the `Link` component from Next.js to create navigation links in your application.
- Add a simple navigation bar or menu that allows users to move between the Home, About, and Contact pages.
- Ensure that the navigation is present and works correctly on each page.

### Exercise 4: Adding Styling

- Add CSS to style your pages. You can use inline styles, CSS modules, or any styling approach you prefer.
- Focus on basic styling elements like font, color, layout, and spacing to make your pages look presentable.

### Exercise 5: Testing Your Application

- Run your Next.js application locally and test the navigation between pages.
- Make sure that all links work as expected and that the styling appears correctly on each page.

## Conclusion

By the end of this lab, you will have a basic understanding of how to create a Next.js application with multiple pages and navigation between them. You will also gain experience in applying basic styling to a Next.js app. This foundation will be invaluable as you continue to explore more advanced features of Next.js in future projects.
