# Pre-course

At the beginning of this course, the readme.md will be the only file in the repo. As we go through the course, code examples, notes and labs will be added. To prepare make sure you can clone this repo using the Git command line or a GUI like Git Desktop.

It would be good to create a folder in this project that you keep all of the code and notes that you make and take. Keeping it in a seperate folder will stop any merge conflicts as we go through the course.
