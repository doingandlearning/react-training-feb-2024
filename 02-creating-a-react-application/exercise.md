# Creating a React Web Application

## Overview
In this lab, you'll create a simple React web application that displays information about books and films in a library. Many of the labs during the course will be based on this scenario. We'll also have a few other scenarios in some other labs, for the sake of variety.

## Roadmap
Here's a brief summary of the exercises in this lab. More detailed instructions follow later in this lab document:

### Exercise 1: Familiarization with the solution web page
Open the following web page in a browser - this is the solution version for the lab, to give you an idea what you're aiming for:
- `solution/index.html`

The web page should appear as follows:

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/kc-cloud/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/raycast-uploads/sqejpgjj9r83eqxt644f" />

Hover over one of the books or films. A tooltip should appear, showing details about that book or film.

### Exercise 2: Getting started with the 'student' web page
Now go to the student folder and open the following web page in a text editor:
- `student/index.html`

This web page contains all the non-React related code you need to get you started. Note the following points:
- We've defined simple classes named Book and Film. Each class has a constructor to initialize an object, and a `toString()` method to return a string representation of the object.
- We've created arrays of books and films. During the lab you'll add React-related code to render this information on the web page.

### Exercise 3: Adding React-related code
Add React-related code to `index.html` to achieve the UI you saw in the solution web app. Here's what you need to do:
- At the beginning of the `<body>` section, define a `<div>` element that will be the target where React will render its content.
- Add `<script>` tags to import the React and ReactDOM libraries.
- Ensure you're using React 18.
- Call `React.createElement()` to create an element for an unordered list of books.
- Call `React.createElement()` to create an element for an unordered list of films.
- Call `React.createElement()` to create a `<div>` to create the overall UI:
  - The My Library heading
  - The Books sub-heading
  - The books list
  - The Films sub-heading
  - The films list
- Use the `ReactDOM.createRoot()` and `root.render()` methods to render the `<div>` in the target element.
  
When you're done, open the web page in the browser and verify it all looks good. If you donâ€™t see any output at all, open Developer Tools in the browser and click the Console tab to see if there are any error messages.
