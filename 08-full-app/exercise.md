# Lab: Building a Web App with API Integration

- Up to coffee and then show and tell

## Overview

In this lab, you'll build a web application that interacts with an external API to fetch and display data. This project will enhance your understanding of asynchronous programming, API integration, and React state management.

## Objective

Create a web application that fetches data from an external API and displays it in a meaningful way. You'll also implement features to interact with this data.

## Suggested APIs

- **REST Countries API**: https://restcountries.com/
- **PokeAPI**: https://pokeapi.co/
- **RandomUser**: https://randomuser.me/
- **Star Wars API**: https://swapi.dev

## Roadmap

1. **Choose an API and Understand its Documentation**

   - Pick an API from the suggested list or find your own.
   - Read and understand the API documentation.
   - Identify the data you want to fetch and display.

2. **Setup Your Project**

   - Create a new React application.
   - Install necessary packages (e.g., `axios` for API requests).

3. **Design Your Application Layout**

   - Plan the layout of your application.
   - Decide on the components you will need.

4. **Fetching Data from the API**

   - Write a function to fetch data from your chosen API.
   - Handle the API response and potential errors.

5. **Displaying the Data**

   - Use the fetched data to populate your components.
   - Ensure your UI updates appropriately with the fetched data.

6. **Implementing User Interactions**

   - Add features that allow users to interact with the data (e.g., filtering, searching).

7. **Storing User Preferences**

   - Optionally, use local storage to remember user settings or preferences.

8. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test your application thoroughly.
   - Fix any bugs and ensure the application runs smoothly.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: API Exploration and Planning

- Choose an API and understand the endpoints you'll be using.
- Sketch the layout of your application and plan the components you'll need.

### Exercise 2: Setting up the Project

- Initialize a new React project.
- Install any additional libraries you might need.

### Exercise 3: API Integration

- Write the logic to fetch data from the API.
- Display a loading indicator while the data is being fetched.

### Exercise 4: Building the UI

- Create React components to display the API data.
- Ensure that your application is visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Exercise 5: Adding Interactivity

- Implement features that allow users to interact with the data.
- This could be through searching, filtering, or sorting the data.

### Exercise 6: Persisting User Preferences (Optional)

- If your app has user preferences (like theme, filters), use local storage to persist these settings.

## Conclusion

This lab will help you gain practical experience in building a modern web application using React and external APIs. It's a great opportunity to understand how real-world applications function and how they interact with external services.
