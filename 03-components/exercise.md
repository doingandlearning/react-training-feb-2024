# Components

## Overview
In this lab, you'll refactor the "library" web page from the previous lab, so that it uses components to render portions of the web page.

You can either choose to implement your components as class-based components or as functional components. We provide solutions for both techniques.


## Roadmap
Here's a brief summary of the exercises in this lab. More detailed instructions follow later in this lab document:

1. Familiarization with the 'solution' web pages
2. Getting started with the 'student' web page
3. Defining an ItemsList component
4. Creating the overall content for the web page
5. (If time permits) Defining a Table component

### Exercise 1: Familiarization with the solution web pages
Open either of the following web pages in a browser:
- `solution/ClassComponents.html`
- `solution/FunctionalComponents.html`

These two web pages are semantically equivalent; one defines class-based components, and the other defines functional components. Both have the same appearance.

Note the following points:
- The upper half of the web page displays books and films as HTML lists. You will implement this functionality in the "core" part of the lab.
- The lower half of the web page displays the books and films as HTML tables. You will implement this functionality in the "if time permits" part of the lab.

### Exercise 2: Getting started with the 'student' web page
Now go to the student folder and open the following web page in a text editor:
- `student/index.html`

This is the same as the solution from the previous lab. Take a moment to reacquaint yourself with the code.

### Exercise 3: Defining an ItemsList component

Define an `ItemsList` component to render an array of objects as an HTML list, as follows:
- Receives 2 properties:
  - `items` - an array of objects to display
  - `ordered` - a bool indicating whether to display an ordered or unordered list
- Returns either an `<ol>` or `<ul>` accordingly, containing `<li>` child elements
- Uses the objects' `toString()` function to display data for each object in the list

Once you've defined the `ItemsList` component, you can delete the original code that declared the `booklist` and `filmlist` variables.

### Exercise 4: Creating the overall content for the web page

Near the bottom of the web page, locate the code that declares the `library` variable. Modify the call to `React.createElement()` as follows:
- Rather than passing `booklist` as a parameter, call `React.createElement()` to create an `ItemsList` component. Pass in the following properties to the component:
  - `items`: `books`
  - `ordered`: `true`
- Rather than passing `filmlist` as a parameter, call `React.createElement()` to create an `ItemsList` component. Pass in the following properties to the component:
  - `items`: `films`
  - `ordered`: `false`

When you've made all these changes, open the web page in a browser and verify everything works correctly.

### Exercise 5 (if time permits): Defining a Table component

Define a `Table` component to render an array of objects as an HTML table, as follows:
- Receives a single property named `items`, an array of objects to display
- Returns a `<table>` with a separate row per object. Display each property value in a separate column.
- For added merit, it would be nice if the table has a heading to display the property names.

You'll also have to enhance the code at the bottom of the web page, where the `library` variable is declared. Enhance this code so that it also renders a `Table` component for the books, and another `Table` component for the films.
